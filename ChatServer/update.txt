2015-11-17 bug fix
bug-1: login() command IO exception. 
description: after about 15 hours when client disconnected, sever lost connection without exception processing when user stay in login stage.
status: fixed
reason: directly call streamReader to obtain data stream. it should call ReceiveFromClient() which includes exception processing.

1.architecture redesign, make it more easier to scale with more complex features.
1)split Command class from User class to support scale of different user map to different command set.
2)split UserStatus class from User class to treat it as configuration. Easy to scale.
2.add "/help command".
